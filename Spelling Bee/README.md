# Spelling Bee Word Finder

***

### Dictionaries I have used:
From here - `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21395011/python-module-with-access-to-english-dictionaries-including-definitions-of-words`

I used this one, webster dictionary - `https://github.com/adambom/dictionary`

*I have converted the JSON file from the Webster Dict to a set, using only it's keys (definitions).*
